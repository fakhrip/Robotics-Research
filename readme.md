# Robotics Research

Welcome to repository about my personal research for robotics stuff, this will include some of interesting research i've done in the past and also might be my current project.

This repository will also contain some usefull tutorial that i will probably make in the future (`with probability == 10%`).

List of research:  
1. [Drug delivery robot](./dwa_based_mobile_robot/)  
   > This is simulation of a mobile robot that will find a path to target location using Dynamic Window Approach implemented in https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics and simulated using CoppeliaSim.
